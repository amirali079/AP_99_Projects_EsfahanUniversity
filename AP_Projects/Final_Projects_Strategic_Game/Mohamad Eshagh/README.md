# Mini-Clash
My first android project for advanced programming course at Esfahan University in the second semester.

In this app we have two teams, each team has three heroes and one castle.In each step heroes detremine their distance to enemy castle in x and y axises and choose the farther one to move and move along that axis according to their speed. If the heroes of team1 and team2 are in the same place, they will fight together according to their power and health, also catles can defend themselvs.The game ends if one castle has no more health or when all the heroes die, in this situation the team whose castle has more health will win and if two castles have same health, the game ends as a draw. 

There is a [Mini Clash.mp4](https://github.com/amirali079/AP_99_Projects_EsfahanUniversity/raw/main/AP_Projects/Final_Projects_Strategic_Game/Mohamad%20Eshagh/Mini%20Clash.mp4) file which simply show you the game.
